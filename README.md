# React Online Marathon (Sprint 14)
Testing JS Applications (React Applications)

## Task
Please write unit tests to check functionality of all modules with using Jest framework
- App component with using Snapshots testing
- DataService class

All testing modules should be placed at <span style="color: red">```src/tests```</span> directory
All test specifications should be real it means that code like this <span style="color: red">```expect(2 + 2).toBe(4)```</span> isn't good :)
Code coverage is calculating by Jest framework and should be at least 90%
